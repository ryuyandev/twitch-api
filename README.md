# Twitch API
This repository contains the source for my Twitch API, which presently only can check the status of a streamer but may be extended later.

It is hosted on a Linux virtual machine on a cloud provider using docker with a CI/CD pipeline that utilizes GitHub Actions, Github Container Registry, and [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower).
